# Vault Chat App (Advanced Version)

This is the **advanced version** of my original chat application, which I developed as part of my graduation project. It has been rebuilt using **Expo** to provide a smoother experience across **mobile** and **web platforms**.

The app uses **Firebase** as the backend for real-time chat, user authentication, cloud storage, and push notifications.
