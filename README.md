# Vault Chat App (Advanced Version)

This is the **advanced version** of my original chat application, which I developed as part of my graduation project. It is now rebuilt using **Expo** to provide a smoother **mobile** and **web** experience.

This version continues to use **Firebase** as the backend for authentication, real-time chat, media storage, and notifications.
